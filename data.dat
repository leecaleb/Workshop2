If you run git commit -a, Git will tell you that nothing has changedâ€¦ and that data.txt is an untracked file

We need to explicitly tell Git to track changes to our new file.
To do this, run git add data.txt. Forgetting to tell Git about new files is an easy mistake to make! 
Always check that your files are added, committed, and pushed to GitHub.com.
